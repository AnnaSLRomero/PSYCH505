### Variable operations exercises
1)
```
sub_code = "sub"
subnr_int = 2
subnr_str = "2"

print(sub_code + subnr_str)
print(sub_code + subnr_int)
```
Only sub_code and subnr_str can create the output 'sub2'. This is because they are both string values that can operations can work on. Meanwhile subnr_int, is an integer that operations cannot work on with string values.
